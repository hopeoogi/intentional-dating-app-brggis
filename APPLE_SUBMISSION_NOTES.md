## Common Questions

### Q: Why increment version for just configuration changes?
**A**: Apple requires a version increment for any new build submission. Even though there are no user-facing changes, we need to increment the version to submit a new build.

### Q: Will users notice any difference?
**A**: No, users won't notice any difference. All features work exactly the same. The changes are purely technical and improve stability.

### Q: Do we need to update privacy policy?
**A**: No, there are no changes to data collection, storage, or privacy practices.

### Q: Do we need to update screenshots?
**A**: No, since there are no user-facing changes, existing screenshots are still accurate.

### Q: How long until we can re-enable updates?
**A**: We'll re-enable over-the-air updates once the build infrastructure issue is resolved by our hosting provider. This doesn't affect app functionality.
