[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I want to build a mobile dating app. Include user profiles, matching algorithm, messaging, location features, and safety tools.  \u201cIntentional\u201d is a new dating app that is exclusive, has no \u201clikes or swipes\u201d (you show interest by starting a conversation which will require a minimum of 36 characters), you get limited daily matches, and in an industry first, every person allowed into the \u201cIntentional\u201d community is verified.  Our verification badges are also different, it is NOT a blue check mark but rather you pick a \u201cstatus\u201d and provide proof that is manually verified by Intentional staff.  For example, if you apply for a \u201cstudent\u201d verification badge, you will need to submit a selfie with your student ID card held to your face as proof you are actually a student.  Once you are approved for your status, your blue status badge will say \u201cstudent\u201d, as an example, on the bottom right corner of your profile picture.  There will be three status levels; basic (blue), elite (purple), and star(gold).  These levels are dependent on the status you are applying for.  You apply for up to three statuses per tier and can technically have up to nine status badges (3 from each tier)\r\n\r\nAnother differentiating quality of the Intentional Dating App is that we have a strict onboarding process on helping people create quality profiles.  No more group pictures or grainy pictures from far away.  Intentional will require a very high, basic set of standards which if the applicant doesn\u2019t meet, they will not be allowed into the community.  Minimum requirement is a selfie with no sun glasses on, full body picture without baggy clothes or jacket, and three activity pictures with only you in it.  There is also an application process to get into our community.  Every new community member must be approved manually by Intentional staff.\r\n\r\nFinally, regarding matches and conversations, we are approaching things differently.  You only get a limited amount of matches per day.  There is no liking or swiping, if you like someone, you must start a conversation with them (minimum 36 characters).  We do this intentionally to make it as though you were meeting someone in real life and you have to go talk to them to introduce yourself.  Also, to prevent ghosting, the receiver has to reply with either at least two characters or press our \u201cEnd Conversation\u201d button which permanently ends the conversation and neither party can make further communication.  This is designed to prevent harassment.\r\n\r\nAlso, in order to get matched, community members must clear their conversations every 24 hours before they can browse through matches and start new communications.  If the conversation is going nowhere, either community member has the option to \u201cEnd Conversation\u201d which will inform the other community member with \u201cThis person no longer wants to talk.  It\u2019s time to move on.\u201d and cease any further communication.  This will prevent harassment and also \u201ccloses the loop\u201d without the ghosting.  Community members must make a decision to advance the conversation by messaging back and forth (no double messaging) or end the conversation.  \r\n\r\nWe are building a dating app with a similar UI to Raya but with our status badges and with a much more rigorous on-boarding process.\r\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand. You're building \"Intentional,\" a unique dating app focused on verified identities, quality profiles, and intentional conversations, drawing inspiration from Raya's UI but with significant differences. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Profile Creation & Verification:** Implement the rigorous onboarding process, including selfie, full body, and activity picture uploads. Develop the status badge system with Basic (Blue), Elite (Purple), and Star (Gold) tiers, and manual verification by staff.\n*   **Matching & Conversation:** Develop the limited daily match system. Implement the \"start a conversation\" approach (minimum 36 characters) instead of likes/swipes. Include the \"End Conversation\" button and the 24-hour conversation clearing rule.\n*   **User Interface:** Design a UI inspired by Raya, but incorporating the status badges on profile pictures. Focus on a clean, exclusive aesthetic.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8F8FF` (Almost White)\n    *   Text: `#282828` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#707070` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#6A5ACD` (Slate Blue - for primary buttons and highlights)\n    *   Secondary: `#B0E2FF` (Light Sky Blue - for accents)\n    *   Accent: `#E6E6FA` (Lavender - for subtle UI elements)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFD700` (Gold - for Star status badges)\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for general text.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Read Existing Files:** Use `read_file_tree()` to understand the project structure.\n2.  **Modify app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx:** Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n3.  **Implement Profile Creation:** Create UI components for uploading the required photos (selfie, full body, activity pictures). Add input fields for profile information.\n4.  **Implement Verification System:** Design the UI for users to apply for status badges and upload proof.\n5.  **Implement Matching and Conversation System:** Develop the logic for limited daily matches. Create the conversation UI with the 36-character minimum and \"End Conversation\" button.\n6.  **Design User Interface:** Style the app with the specified colors and typography, taking inspiration from Raya's UI. Incorporate status badges on profile pictures.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-30T14:33:27.156109"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching the knowledge base for relevant information about building dating apps, user profiles, messaging systems, and verification features."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the existing files to understand the current structure:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "constants/Colors.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/FloatingTabBar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me create the comprehensive dating app \"Intentional\" with all the requested features.
